    The Nailers Song</a> (J Boyes)</font></b></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I’m a hard man, I’m a Nailer
    <br>
    Not your tinker, not your tailor <br>
    I’d fight a soldier, I’d fight a sailor <br>
    You won’t find me against a wall <br>
    They call me Tiny, they call me Sojer <br>
    They call me Shearer, they call me Bodger <br>
    They call me Nobbin, they call me Filler <br>
    They call me Syntax and that’s not all <br>
    <br>
    I’ve got fifty six pounds of Iron <br>
    I make a living – that’s if I’m trying <br>
    But I’m not the one you can rely on <br>
    I’m in the beer shop, I’m in the pub <br>
    I’ve gone off shearing, I’m on a bender <br>
    And when I come home I can’t remember <br>
    Except when it comes to Monday <br>
    Or when I’ve spent me sub <br>
    <br>
    I get the children to light the fire <br>
    And as the charcoal flames get higher <br>
    I get the wife to apply the bellows <br>
    I set to work and I hammer on <br>
    I can make three nails in one heating <br>
    These Belper nails Lads, they take some beating <br>
    I’ve got to stop now I’ve got a meeting <br>
    Of the Union in the White Swan <br>
    <br>
    Oh St. Monday, Oh St. Monday <br>
    When shall I have my reprieve <br>
    After Sunday, after Sunday <br>
    I believe, I believe <br>
    <br>
    We fought the navvies in ’37 <br>
    A Tommy ‘ammer armageddon <br>
    We fought the circus just 8 years later <br>
    But the leaders were made to pay <br>
    Bare knuckle fighting it is our leisure <br>
    It is our sport and it is our pleasure <br>
    At Cross ‘o th Hands, lads we’ve got there measure <br>
    And the constable’s far away </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>(Sometimes we're paid in 
    money<br>
    Which is fine if it isn't funny<br>
    But other times we get a piece of paper<br>
    to spend in the Tommy Shop<br>
    Where the Nailmaster sells provisions<br>
    And the price causes derision<br>
    And sometimes you buy his elbow<br>
    If your eyes aren't like organ stops)</i><br>
    <br>
    In the sixties there was trouble <br>
    Dissatisfaction began to bubble <br>
    We struck for 6d and we were locked out <br>
    By the Nailmasters we were fooled <br>
    They employ blacklegs, and not our brothers <br>
    They say one thing then do another <br>
    But we’re a flame that they cannot smother <br>
    We’ll not be beaten, we’ll not be ruled <br>
    <br>
    Though conditions they were fearful <br>
    We had reasons to be cheerful <br>
    There was game in the park aplenty <br>
    And we stored it beneath a tomb <br>
    But after 6 months we forced back <br>
    Solidarity we never once lacked <br>
    Our resolve became all the stronger <br>
    And it helped us through the gloom <br>
    <br>
    Oh St. Monday, Oh St. Monday <br>
    It’s still good to be alive <br>
    After Sunday, after Sunday <br>
    We survived, we survived <br>
    <br>
    <i>(Now although our trades declining <br>
    Every cloud has a silver lining <br>
    And though we fought against the Tommy Hammer <br>
    In the end things have got to change <br>
    But we learned determination <br>
    And despite rules and regulation <br>
    Things can always be re-aranged) </i> <br>
    <br>
    Now my song is almost ended <br>
    And not quite as it was intended <br>
    It’s never least said soon is mended <br>
    When it comes to troubled times <br>
    So put your cards upon the table <br>
    Speak your mind as you are able <br>
    Never doubt that you are stronger <br>
    When in union you’re combined <br>
    <br>
    So come all you lads and lasses <br>
    And fill up your empty glasses <br>
    And drink a health to the Belper Nailers <br>
    Though they’re long since dead and gone <br>
    You can hear them in every footfall <br>
    In Belper Town and at the football <br>
    They say ‘never to be beaten’ <br>
    They lived to fight and they labour on </font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All things are quite silent, 
    each mortal at rest,<br>
    When me and my true love lay snug in one nest,<br>
    When a bold set of ruffians broke into our cave,<br>
    And they forced my dear jewel to plough the salt waves.<br>
    <br>
    I begged hard for my darling as I would for my life,<br>
    But they'd not listen to me, a lonely poor wife,<br>
    Saying the King must have sailors; to the seas he must go,<br>
    And they left me lamenting in sorrow and woe.<br>
    <br>
    Through green fields and meadows we oft times did walk,<br>
    And with fond recollections together we'd talk,<br>
    While the lark and the blackbird so sweetly did sing,<br>
    And the sweet thrushes' voices made the valleys to ring.<br>
    <br>
    Well I'll not be forsaken; I'll not be cast down,<br>
    Who knows but my true love one day will return,<br>
    And he'll make me amends for my trouble and strife,<br>
    And me and my dear will be happy for life.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The eighteenth day of March, 
    me lads, will long be handed down<br>
    When thousands came from miles around into fair Derby town<br>
    To see the great footrace being run for a hundred guineas a side<br>
    Twixt Shaw the Stafford hero and Wantling Derby's pride<br>
    <br>
    Fol-de-rol, fol-de-rey, to Derby make your way<br>
    To see the two brave heroes run the great footrace today<br>
    <br>
    And now the day it is drawn nigh when the heroes try their skill<br>
    While thousands flock around the streets wagering who will<br>
    Large sums they are laid down me boys, e'er they begin to run<br>
    In mingled shouts you'll hear em cry &quot;Ill take you're bet&quot; and &quot;Done&quot;<br>
    <br>
    And now we see them striving, which one will get there first<br>
    Straining vein and muscle boys 'til their lungs almost burst<br>
    Young Wantling takes the lead now and he labours hard to gain<br>
    The money for his friends and to establish his own fame&lt;-!&gt;<br>
    <br>
    And now the race is over and the women, men and boys<br>
    Cry &quot;Wantling now forever&quot; in shouts that wrend the skies<br>
    His name today is lifted up as a Hero of great fame<br>
    For Shaw the stafford hero has been whooped by him again<br>
    <br>
    Ye noble lads of Staffordshire who backed Shaw on this day<br>
    And ventured all your money, leaving none of your shots to pay<br>
    Be wiser in the future if again you chance to come<br>
    And bring more money with you, lads, lest you go empty home</font></p>

    Lame from the cradle and forced for to beg<br>
    <br>
    And a beggin' I will go me lads, a beggin' I will go<br>
    <br>
    I've a little bag for me oatmeal, another one for me salt<br>
    With me two wee bonny crutches you can see me swing and halt<br>
    <br>
    And a beggin'….<br>
    <br>
    I've a little bag for me wheat, sir, another for me rye<br>
    With a little bottle by me side to drink when I am dry<br>
    <br>
    Seven years I've begged for me old Master Wild<br>
    He taught me how to beg sir when I was but a child<br>
    <br>
    I've begged for me Master and got him store of pelf<br>
    But now the Lord be praised, Sir, I'm begging for meself<br>
    <br>
    In a hollow tree I live, Sir, and there I pay no rent<br>
    Providence provides for me and I am well content<br>
    <br>
    Oh I've been blind a hundred times and deaf a score or more<br>
    Many's the right and willing lad I've bedded in the straw<br>
    <br>
    Of all the trades in England, the beggin' is the best<br>
    For when a beggar's tired, he can lay himself to rest<br>
    <br>
    Of all the trades in England, the beggin' is the one<br>
    For we live a life of going to do and die with nothing done!</font></p>

    Well, he in Derbyshire did dwell<br>
    He had three sons of which you'll hear<br>
    Oh that old miller, he lived well<br>
    So he called up his eldest son<br>

    Adrenaline rush and pounding heart in my mouth<br>
    My muscles were flexed and feeling ready to run<br>
    The crowd was wild, crying and jeering us on.<br>
    <br>
    Chorus<br>
    The cries grew louder and whistles did fly<br>
    With stamping hooves, we all thundered by.<br>
    Rounding the corner, I tripped as I ran,<br>
    Catch up again with the others, <br>
    <br>
    If I can -------- (if I can)<br>
    <br>
    Some of the men were waving sticks in their hands<br>
    They talk of respect, (oh but what of their plans….)<br>
    Beating and kicking, chasing them all up and down.<br>
    Race to the end and finally the drum beats us round.<br>
    <br>
    I was the one, the one who turned and saw red,<br>
    The flick of a shirt, flashing too close to my head.<br>
    I turned to the right, I had him fixed in my stare,<br>
    Quick as flash, tossed him up in the air.<br>

    Chorus x 2<br>

    Come all you young men, the brave and the free<br>
    They'll be mayhem and bloodshed when you're starting to flee.<br>
    I can sense your excitement, see the fear in your eyes<br>
    You can hide in your cages, (with your taunts and your cries.)<br>
